# Unit Testing Patterns

This reference provides detailed unit testing patterns across TypeScript, Python, Go, and Rust.

See `examples/typescript/vitest-unit.test.ts` for complete TypeScript unit testing examples.

See `examples/python/pytest_unit_test.py` for complete Python unit testing examples.

## Key Patterns

**Pure Function Testing**: Test functions with no side effects.

**Parametrized Testing**: Test multiple inputs efficiently.

**Fixture Usage**: Reusable test data and setup.

**Edge Case Testing**: Handle boundary conditions.
