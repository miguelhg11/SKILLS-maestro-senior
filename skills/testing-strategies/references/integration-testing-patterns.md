# Integration Testing Patterns

This reference provides detailed integration testing patterns including API testing, database integration, and service communication.

See `examples/typescript/vitest-integration.test.ts` for complete TypeScript integration testing examples with MSW.

## Key Patterns

**API Integration Testing**: Test endpoints with real database, mocked external APIs.

**Database Integration**: Use ephemeral databases (Docker, in-memory).

**Service Communication**: Test component interactions.

**Request/Response Validation**: Verify API contracts.

For complete implementation details and working code, refer to the examples directory and `mocking-strategies.md`.
