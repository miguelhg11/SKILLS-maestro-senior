# End-to-End Testing Patterns

This reference provides detailed E2E testing patterns with Playwright across multiple languages.

## Key Patterns

**User Workflow Testing**: Test complete user journeys.

**Cross-Browser Testing**: Validate across Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.

**Stable Selectors**: Use data-testid attributes.

**Retry Logic**: Handle network flakiness.

**Fixtures for Authentication**: Reuse authenticated state.
