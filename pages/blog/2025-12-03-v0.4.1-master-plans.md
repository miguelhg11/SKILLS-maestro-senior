## What's New

This release expands our capabilities beyond frontend UI components to cover the entire development lifecycle:

- **47 new skill master plans** across 8 major categories
- **Multi-language support** in 9 skills (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust)
- **Research-backed recommendations** using Google Search Grounding and Context7
- **Production-ready tool recommendations** with trust scores and benchmarks

- **Go** - Cloud-native systems
- **Rust** - Performance-critical applications

Skills with multi-language support:
- `testing-strategies`, `building-clis`, `designing-sdks`, `debugging-techniques`
- `streaming-data`, `transforming-data`, `shell-scripting`, `optimizing-sql`
- All cloud pattern skills include Terraform, CDK, and native SDK examples

## Research Methodology

Every init.md includes research from:
- **Google Search Grounding** - 100+ queries for 2025 best practices
- **Context7** - Library trust scores and documentation quality
  - Example: Argo CD (91.8/100), MLflow (95/100)
- **Decision frameworks** with actionable guidance
- **Production-ready tool recommendations**

## Statistics

- **Total init.md files:** 47
- **Total lines written:** 90,839
- **Average lines per skill:** 1,933
- **Skills with SKILL.md (production):** 29
- **Total skill coverage:** 76 skills (29 frontend + 14 backend + 33 new)

## Next Steps

These master plans serve as comprehensive blueprints for creating production-ready SKILL.md files. The next phase will implement progressive disclosure patterns following Anthropic's best practices:

1. **SKILL.md creation** - Main skill files (&lt;500 lines)
2. **Reference documentation** - Detailed guides in references/
3. **Code examples** - Working implementations in examples/
4. **Utility scripts** - Token-free automation in scripts/
