# 100% Progressive Disclosure Coverage

**Major Achievement:** All 29 production skills now have complete progressive disclosure with **zero broken references**. We created 110 new files across 17 skills in a comprehensive 7-hour sprint to achieve 100% completion.

## The Journey

Starting from 41% completion with 116 missing files, we systematically completed progressive disclosure across all skills in 4 phases:

- **Phase 0:** Low Priority (7 skills, 20 files)
- **Phase 1:** Medium Priority (4 skills, 22 files)
- **Phase 2:** High Priority (4 skills, 30 files)
- **Phase 3:** Critical Priority (2 skills, 38 files)

## What We Created

### 110 Files Total

- **54 reference guides** - Comprehensive documentation
- **42 code examples** - Working implementations across Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go
- **12 automation scripts** - Token-free execution utilities
- **2 configuration assets** - Templates and schemas

### Complete Coverage Now Includes

**Database Skills**
- All database types: relational, document, vector, timeseries, graph
- Query optimization, indexing strategies, schema design
- Language support: Python (SQLAlchemy, Prisma), TypeScript (Drizzle, Prisma), Rust (sqlx, Diesel), Go (sqlc, GORM)

**API Patterns**
- REST, GraphQL, gRPC, tRPC implementations
- 5 languages: Python (FastAPI, Strawberry), TypeScript (Express, tRPC), Rust (Axum), Go (Gin), with complete examples

**AI/ML Pipeline**
- RAG implementations with chunking strategies
- Embedding optimization and vector search
- Data versioning and orchestration patterns
- Complete Qdrant setup and evaluation scripts

**Chat Interfaces**
- Streaming responses with SSE
- Multi-modal input handling (text, images, files)
- Tool-calling patterns
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

**Dashboard Components**
- Executive dashboards with KPIs
- Monitoring dashboards with real-time data
- Customizable layouts and themes
- Grid systems and responsive patterns

**Data Tables**
- Basic, interactive, and advanced grid patterns
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Inline editing and state persistence
- Server-side sorting and filtering
- TanStack Table and AG Grid examples

**Media Handling**
- Image upload, cropping, and optimization
- Video players with HLS/DASH streaming
- Audio players with waveform visualization
- PDF viewers (iframe, PDF.js, React-PDF)
- Office document viewers
- Cloud storage integration (S3, GCS, Cloudinary)

**Message Queues**
- BullMQ (Redis-based) and Celery (Python) guides
- Complete workflow examples with Temporal
- Retry patterns and error handling

**Observability**
- LGTM stack (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir)
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Automated setup scripts

**Full-Stack Templates**
- Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django)
- TypeScript (Next.js, Express)
- Rust (Axum, Actix)
- Go (Gin, Echo)

## Impact

This milestone means:

✅ **All 29 skills are production-ready**
✅ **Zero broken references** - every link works
✅ **Progressive disclosure intact** - efficient token usage
✅ **Multi-language support** - Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go
✅ **Complete documentation** - references for every pattern
✅ **Working examples** - copy-paste ready code
✅ **Token-free scripts** - automation without context cost

## The Difference

**Before:** Skills had incomplete progressive disclosure, broken references, missing examples

**After:** Every skill has:
1. **SKILL.md** (&lt;500 lines) - Main skill file
2. **references/** - Detailed documentation files
3. **examples/** - Production-ready code
4. **scripts/** - Utility automation

## What's Next

With all 29 frontend/backend skills complete, we're expanding to:

- **DevOps Skills** - CI/CD, infrastructure, deployment
- **Security Skills** - Auth, secrets, compliance
- **Cloud Skills** - AWS, GCP, Azure patterns
- **AI/ML Skills** - MLOps, embeddings, evaluation

See [v0.4.1 release](/blog/v0.4.1-master-plans) for details on 47 new skill master plans.

## By the Numbers
