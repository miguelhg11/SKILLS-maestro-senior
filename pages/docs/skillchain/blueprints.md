# Blueprints

Blueprints are pre-configured skill chains that provide fast-track workflows for common application patterns. Instead of answering 12+ questions, blueprints reduce setup to just 3-4 key decisions.

## What are Blueprints?

A blueprint is a pre-configured skill chain that:

1. **Matches common patterns** - Recognizes dashboard, CRUD API, RAG pipeline, etc.
2. **Pre-selects skills** - Automatically chooses the right skills in correct order
3. **Provides smart defaults** - Offers opinionated defaults that work together
4. **Reduces questions** - Only asks essential configuration questions
5. **Ensures consistency** - All pieces integrate seamlessly

### Benefits

| Without Blueprint | With Blueprint |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 12+ configuration questions | 3-4 key questions |
| Must understand skill dependencies | Dependencies pre-configured |
| Risk of incompatible choices | Tested combinations only |
| 8-12 minute setup | 5-7 minute setup |

## Available Blueprints (12)

## Using Blueprints

### Automatic Detection

Blueprints are automatically detected based on keywords in your goal:

```bash
# Dashboard blueprint detected
/skillchain:start analytics dashboard
/skillchain:start admin panel with metrics
/skillchain:start KPI overview

# CRUD API blueprint detected
/skillchain:start REST API with postgres
/skillchain:start FastAPI CRUD endpoints
/skillchain:start backend API server

# RAG pipeline blueprint detected
/skillchain:start RAG system
/skillchain:start semantic search with embeddings
/skillchain:start document Q&A knowledge base
```

### Detection Confidence

Blueprints use a confidence threshold (70%):

```
Confidence calculation:
- Primary keyword match: +10 points each
- Secondary keyword match: +5 points each
- Threshold: 7 points (70%)

Example:
"/skillchain:start analytics dashboard with KPI cards"
- "analytics" (secondary): +5
- "dashboard" (primary): +10
- "KPI" (secondary): +5
Total: 20 points (200%) → HIGH confidence, offer blueprint
```

### Blueprint Prompt

When detected, you'll see:

```
🎯 I detected this matches our 'dashboard' blueprint!

This blueprint provides:
- Pre-configured skill chain (7 skills)
- Optimized defaults
- Only 3 questions instead of 12+
- Estimated time: 5 minutes

Would you like to use the dashboard blueprint?
  → yes (use preset with 3 questions)
  → no (manual configuration with 12+ questions)
  → customize (preset + ability to modify defaults)
```

### Choosing an Option

**Option 1: Yes (Recommended)**
```
You: yes

# Uses blueprint with minimal questions
# Fastest path to working code
# Best for prototyping and common patterns
```

**Option 2: No**
```
You: no

# Manual skill selection
# Full control over every decision
# Best for unique requirements
```

**Option 3: Customize**
```
You: customize

# Starts with blueprint configuration
# Allows overriding specific defaults
# Best for "mostly standard" patterns
```

## Creating Custom Blueprints

You can extend skillchain with your own blueprints.

### Blueprint Structure

```

### Registering Custom Blueprints

Add to `_registry.yaml`:

```yaml
blueprints:
  ecommerce:
    description: "E-commerce store with cart and checkout"
    category: fullstack
    confidence_threshold: 0.7

    triggers:
      primary: [store, shop, ecommerce, cart]
      secondary: [products, catalog, payment]

    skill_chain:
      - theming-components
      - designing-layouts
      - building-tables
      - building-forms
      - api-patterns
      - databases-relational
      - assembling-components

    quick_questions: 5
    estimated_time: "8 minutes"

    file: "{SKILLCHAIN_DIR}/blueprints/ecommerce.md"
```

## Blueprint Best Practices

### 1. Focus on Common Patterns

Create blueprints for patterns you build repeatedly:
- Dashboard (used by 80% of apps)
- CRUD API (foundational backend)
- RAG pipeline (emerging AI pattern)

### 2. Optimize Question Count

Aim for 3-5 questions:
- Too few (1-2): Not enough customization
- Just right (3-5): Fast but flexible
- Too many (8+): Defeats blueprint purpose

### 3. Provide Sensible Defaults

Choose defaults that work for 80% of cases:
```yaml
# Good defaults
color_scheme: "blue-gray"  # Neutral, professional
database: "postgres"       # Most popular
framework: "react"         # Widest adoption
```

### 4. Test Skill Combinations

Ensure pre-configured skills work together:
- All dependencies satisfied
- No conflicting configurations
- Tested end-to-end

### 5. Document Output Clearly

Users should know what they'll get:
```markdown
## Output Includes
- Responsive dashboard layout
- 5 pre-built chart components
- Dark mode support
- Loading states
```

## Troubleshooting

### Blueprint Not Detected

**Problem:** Keywords not matching

**Solution:** Use more specific blueprint keywords
```bash
# Instead of:
/skillchain:start data display page

# Use:
/skillchain:start analytics dashboard
```

### Wrong Blueprint Detected

**Problem:** Multiple blueprints match

**Solution:** Add exclusion keywords or be more specific
```bash
# If RAG blueprint triggers for general "search":
/skillchain:start product search filter  # "filter" + "product" = frontend
```

### Want Blueprint But Need Customization

**Problem:** Blueprint is 90% right

**Solution:** Choose "customize" option
```
Claude: Use dashboard blueprint? (yes/no/customize)
You: customize
```
