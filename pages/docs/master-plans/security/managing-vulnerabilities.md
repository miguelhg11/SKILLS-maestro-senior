# Vulnerability Management

:::info Status
**Master Plan** - Comprehensive init.md complete, ready for SKILL.md implementation
:::

Vulnerability management is essential for identifying and remediating security weaknesses. This skill covers scanning tools (Trivy, Grype, Snyk), SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation, CVE prioritization, and automated remediation workflows.

## Scope

This skill teaches:

- **Vulnerability Scanning** - Container images, dependencies, infrastructure
- **SBOM Generation** - Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security
- **CVE Prioritization** - CVSS scoring, exploitability assessment, EPSS
- **Remediation Workflows** - Patch management, dependency updates, CI/CD integration
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Automated scanning in pipelines and production
- **Reporting** - Vulnerability dashboards, compliance reporting

## Key Components

### Scanning Tools

**Trivy** (Aqua Security)
- Container image scanning
- Filesystem scanning
- Git repository scanning
- SBOM generation
- Open source, fast, accurate

**Grype** (Anchore)
- Container image and filesystem scanning
- CVE database matching
- High performance
- CI/CD integration

**Snyk**
- Open source dependencies
- Container images
- IaC security
- Commercial with free tier

**Scout** (Docker)
- Built into Docker
- Image scanning via Docker CLI
- CVE database integration

### SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)

**Purpose:**
- Inventory all software components
- Track dependencies and versions
- Supply chain security compliance

**Generation Tools:**
- Syft (Anchore) - SBOM generator
- Trivy - Built-in SBOM support
- CycloneDX - SBOM standard format

**Example Workflow:**
```bash
# Generate SBOM
syft image:tag -o cyclonedx-json > sbom.json

# Scan SBOM for vulnerabilities
grype sbom:sbom.json
```

### CVE Prioritization

**CVSS Scoring:**
- Base score (0-10): Severity rating
- Temporal score: Exploit availability, patch status
- Environmental score: Context-specific impact

**Exploitability (EPSS):**
- Exploit Prediction Scoring System
- Probability of exploitation in next 30 days
- Prioritize high EPSS scores

**Decision Matrix:**
| CVSS | EPSS | Priority |
|------|------|----------|
| Critical (9-10) | High (>50%) | **P0 - Immediate** |
| High (7-8.9) | High (>50%) | **P1 - This week** |
| Critical | Low (&lt;10%) | **P1 - This week** |
| High | Low (&lt;10%) | **P2 - This month** |
| Medium (4-6.9) | Any | **P3 - Next quarter** |

### Remediation Workflows

**Automated Patching:**
1. CI/CD scans detect vulnerability
2. Dependabot/Renovate creates pull request
3. Automated tests run
4. Auto-merge if tests pass (for low-risk updates)
5. Deploy patched version

**Manual Remediation:**
1. Security team triages vulnerability
2. Creates JIRA ticket with priority
3. Engineering team patches and tests
4. Security team verifies fix
5. Deploy to production

## Decision Framework

**Which Scanning Tool?**

```
Container images?
  YES → Trivy (comprehensive, open source)
        OR Grype (performance-focused)
        OR Docker Scout (Docker native)

Dependencies (npm, pip, maven)?
  YES → Snyk (best dependency coverage)
        OR npm audit / pip-audit (native)

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)?
  YES → Checkov (comprehensive IaC scanning)
        OR tfsec (Terraform-specific)

Comprehensive platform?
  YES → Snyk (commercial, all-in-one)
        OR Aqua Security (enterprise)
```

**Vulnerability Prioritization:**

```
Exploitable in production?
  YES → **P0 - Patch within 24-48 hours**

Publicly exploited (CISA KEV list)?
  YES → **P0 - Immediate patching**

Critical CVSS + high EPSS?
  YES → **P1 - Within 7 days**

Critical CVSS + low EPSS?
  YES → **P1 - Within 30 days**

High/Medium CVSS?
  YES → **P2/P3 - Normal patch cycle**
```

## Tool Recommendations

### Open Source Scanning

**Trivy:**
```bash
# Scan image
trivy image nginx:latest

# Generate SBOM
trivy image --format cyclonedx nginx:latest

# Scan filesystem
trivy fs /path/to/project
```

**Grype:**
```bash
# Scan image
grype nginx:latest

# Scan directory
grype dir:/path/to/project

# Scan SBOM
grype sbom:./sbom.json
```

### Dependency Management

**Dependabot** (GitHub)
- Automated dependency updates
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Auto-merge for low-risk updates

**Renovate** (Mend.io)
- Multi-platform support (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- More configurable than Dependabot
- Self-hosted option available

**Snyk:**
- Commercial platform
- Real-time vulnerability database
- Fix pull requests
- Policy-based automation

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
- name: Run Trivy scanner
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: '${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    exit-code: '1'  # Fail build on vulnerabilities
```

**GitLab CI:**
```yaml
container_scanning:
  image: docker:stable
  variables:
    DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
  services:
    - docker:dind
  script:
    - docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      aquasec/trivy image $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_COMMIT_SHA
```

## Integration Points

**With Other Skills:**
- `building-ci-pipelines` - Scan in CI/CD pipelines
- `operating-kubernetes` - Runtime vulnerability scanning (Falco)
- `writing-infrastructure-code` - Scan IaC for security issues
- `implementing-compliance` - Vulnerability management for compliance
- `architecting-security` - Risk assessment and threat modeling

**Workflow Example:**
```
Code Commit → Build → Scan → Prioritize → Remediate → Deploy
     │          │       │         │          │          │
